Golf Scores -  Python

The Springfork Amateur Golf Club has a tournament every weekend. The club president has asked you to design two programs in Python.

A program that will read each player’s name and golf score as keyboard input and then save these as records in a file named golf.dat. (Each record will have a field for the player’s name and a field for the player’s score.)  The user should be able to enter this data until they say they are finished.

A program that reads the records from the golf.dat file and displays them.  The program should also display the name of the player with the best (lowest) golf score.
